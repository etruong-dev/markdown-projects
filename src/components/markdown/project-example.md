As defined by [Adobe,](https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/guides/ux-design-process-steps/) the UX process follows these five key phases:

2. Research
3. Analysis
4. Design

- Information Architecture
- Components

(sketching, wireframe, and prototype)  
create assets  
High-fidelity design Mock up

## Validation ( testing )

Evaluation  
FeedBack  
User acceptance  
success rate

Design Iteration, changes

## Learning

What I learned in the process, what I could do better, road map, WIP
